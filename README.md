Simple Keylog is being developed in Python and is a *work in progress*. The purpose is to log every key that has been pressed on the host computer and save it to a .txt file
- If the file has not been created, the script will create it. If the the .txt already exists, text will be appended to it.
- For backspace, the log will be shown as <*BackSpace*> and Enter as <*Enter*>
